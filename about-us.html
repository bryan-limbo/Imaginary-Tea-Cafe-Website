            <p class="about-us-text">LBS of Tea was founded by three people who all share a passion for tea. The term
                "tea" is also a slang for gossip, typically shared between friends. It's a time for bonding and
                applicable to all ages.</p>

            <p class="about-us-text">With this idea in mind, this cafe was created to bring people together; spending
                qualiTEA time with one another.</p>

            <p class="about-us-text">Meet the creative minds behind it all!</p>

            <div class="about-us-main-boxes">
                <p>Born in Vancouver, BC, Bryan has been a tea-lover since young. While most people drink coffee to
                    wake themselves up, Bryan brews a fresh cup of tea. The refreshing and cleansing feeling washes
                    away the impurities of yesterday.</p>
                <p>In his spare time, he enjoys playing basketball and trying out new food. Pre-pandemic, Bryan would
                    travel to different countries for leisure and to learn about how tea is valued there. </p>

                <p>A popular member of the Korean girl group "TWICE", her parents own a teashop in Tainan, Taiwan.
                    Expanding her roots and her parents' business, she wanted to preserve the tea culture in Vancouver
                    too.</p>
                <p>Known for her strong visuals, many customers come to get a glimpse of her beauty. She prides herself
                    in obtaining only the finest ingredients, and as such, is an integral part of the team.</p>

                <p>Her favourite drink is "sereniTEA" because it helps keep the creativity flowing. A
                    customer-favourite, but no doubt that Mina's intellect has contributed largely to the success of
